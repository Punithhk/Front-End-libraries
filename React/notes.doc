Trying to create  React project 
without using create-react-app. 

npm init -y //generates package.json file

npm install react react-dom serve 
// gives the node modules, package-lock.json

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli

We’ll need babel-loader and
@babel/core:
npm install babel-loader @babel/core --save-dev

“Hey Babel. If
you see some ESNext syntax here, go ahead and transform that code into syntax we’re
sure the browser understands. If you see some JSX, transform that too.” Start by
installing the presets:
npm install @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react --save-dev

Webpack is run statically. Typically, bundles are created before the app is deployed to
the server. You can run it from the command line using npx:
Intro to webpack | 93

npx webpack --mode development
Webpack will either succeed and create a bundle or fail and show you an error

"build": "webpack --mode production"
  in scripts of package.json

npm run build
// getting 1 error

dist folder contains files we want to run on web server

Bundling our code into a single file can cause some setbacks when it comes time to
debug the application in the browser. We can eliminate this problem by providing a
source map. A source map is a file that maps a bundle to the original source files.
With webpack, all we have to do is add a couple lines to our webpack.config.js file.

useref is beautiful, it can be used to create 
uncontrolled Components 

In React, a ref is an object that stores values for the lifetime
of a component. There are several use cases that involve using refs. In this section,
we’ll look at how we can access a DOM node directly with a ref.


-----------------------------------------
Hooks 

useState
useMemo
useEffect
useLayoutEffect 
useCallback


Rules of hooks 
Hooks only run in the scope of a component
It’s a good idea to break functionality out into multiple Hooks
Hooks should only be called at the top level
  Hooks should be used at the top level of a React function. They cannot be placed
into conditional statements, loops, or nested functions
PureComponent is only for class components;
React.memo is only for function components.


functions like 

memo
reducer 

------------------------
Tokens can also be obtained from third parties like GitHub or
Facebook using with an open standard protocol called OAuth.
The useState hook is used to store the response in state, and
the useEffect hook is used to make the fetch request.
